# racehorse-ai-lab

This is a small experimental project to run a 30-day test of a daily UK horse racing
"bet of the day" picked by an OpenAI model.

**What it does:**

- You provide a small list of *real* horses for today's races in a simple JSON file.
- The model picks one "bet of the day" and explains why it likes the value.
- After the race, you record whether it won and the SP odds.
- A CSV file tracks profit and ROI over time so you can see how it's doing.

This version keeps everything very simple and GitHub-friendly, so you can run it
comfortably inside a GitHub Codespace.
